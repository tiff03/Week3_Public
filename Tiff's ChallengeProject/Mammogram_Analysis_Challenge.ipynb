        "# Mammogram Analysis Challenge\n",
        "\n",
        "A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast used primarily by radiologists to detect signs of breast cancer like abnormal masses and calcifications (signs of a possible tumor). Sometimes these abnormalities are obvious, sometimes they are not. In younger women especially, masses and calcifications can be difficult for radiologists to detect in a mammogram due to dense surrounding tissue. This makes mammograms a great candidate for machine learning analysis. A program that can detect abnormalities with high accuracy could be used to catch radiologists' mistakes and potentially save lives (in fact, it already isâ€”https://giving.massgeneral.org/machine-learning-breast-cancer-screening)\n",

        "\n",
        "For this challenge you will classify mammogram segments into two classes (positive for an abnormality and negative). You may also attempt to use the \"multiclass labels\" to classify the mammograms into five classes (negative, positive benign calcification, positive malignant calcification, positive benign mass, and positive malignant mass). We recommend you begin with the binary labels, but try both if you have time!\n",
        "\n",
        "Below we provide you with code to visualize the dataset as well as a simple but functional model that does a relatively poor job at this classification problem. It's up to you to build a classifier that does better! Your models will be evaluated based on confusion matrix , Area under the ROC Curve, and Creativity.\n",

In the case of a multi-class ROC curve, each class is considered separately before taking the weighted average of all the class results.
